## Introduction
Inspired by [OSSU's Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), this is my attempt at cobbling together an education in Science and the Humanities. The 'Science' portion wll focus on principles of the respective scientific fields. Courses that focus on application of scientific principles like engineering will be hosted on [MOOC](https://github.com/khkhiu/MOOC) repository. The 'Humanities' portion will focus on Philosophy, Politics, Economics and History, with a few other fields sprinkled throughout.
